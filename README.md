# ALGORITHM:

At first, this problem is expressed in the form of a graph where the child nodes of a parent node (i.e specific day) represent the individual subject names.This graph is represented by using an adjacency matrix created by using a vector of vector of string with respect to Standard Template Library in C++ language.

In order to display the routine, a traversal algorithm similar to DFS, named as nDFS in the program is used which will visit all the subject nodes of the graph corresponding to specific day parent nodes.
